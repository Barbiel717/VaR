# VaR, CVaR  - Value at Risk, Expected shortfall 


This small project is about computing value at risk using different methods such as :

- Exponentially weighted moving average

- GARCH

- Historically simulation

- Monte Carlo simulation

- Exteme value theory

- Copulas

The computation have been backtested against several equity indices and foreign exchanges.

The code is written in C++ and relies on Boost and Eigen libraries. It has been compiled using GNU compiler.
